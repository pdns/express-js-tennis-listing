# express-js-tennis-listing
A Node.js/Express application that lists information from a MongoDB service.

Written during September of 2014. It was developed (fairly quickly) in order to find the most convenient tennis courts in Ottawa for me and my friend to play at.

This Node.js application reads the tennis court information from a MongoDB service and renders it in a table using the Jade templating engine.

You can see this application running at www.pdunsworth.com.

The tennis court information and other information is available freely at [OpenData Ottawa](http://data.ottawa.ca/en) under their [terms of use](http://ottawa.ca/en/mobile-apps-and-open-data/open-data-terms-use).
