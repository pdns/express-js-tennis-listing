# express-js-tennis-listing
A Node.js/Express application that lists information from a MongoDB service.

Written during September of 2014. It was developed (fairly quickly) in order to find the most convenient tennis courts in Ottawa for my friend and I to play at.

This Node.js application reads the tennis court information from a MongoDB service and renders it in a table using the Jade templating engine.

The tennis court information and other information is available freely at [OpenData Ottawa](http://data.ottawa.ca/en) under their [terms of use](http://ottawa.ca/en/mobile-apps-and-open-data/open-data-terms-use).
